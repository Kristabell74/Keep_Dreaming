# Keep Dreaming

This app is designed to help find the best travel destination options based on your preferences. Those include: how much you can spend, the general location you want, the type of vacation you want to have, and whether or not it is kid friendly.

## Motivation

Stuck at home in the middle of a pandemic? Ready to dream up that vacation for when you can travel again but don't know where to go? Well look no further! This app was designed with you in mind. The goal is to give the user a destination based on his or her preferences. Dream away!
